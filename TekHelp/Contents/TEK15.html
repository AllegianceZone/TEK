Tigereye's Kneeboard is an Allegiance take on the info board strapped to pilot's knees in planes everywhere. It's a program that acts as your quick-reference card of all technology within Allegiance.

You can quickly look up how long it will take to kill an enemy miner with your scout, or how many Anti-Base missiles it'd take to down that Garrison with your 25 Kill Bonus and the Missile Damage 2 GA.

Commanders can use it to learn the research tree and doublecheck what the prerequisites were for something, and also calculate how much money they'd need to do it.
